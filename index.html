      <h2>Leadership & Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        I am a husband, a father, and an active-duty veteren. I've
        had the unique responsibility of leading Americans from 
        every background in our nations Army. The rich and the poor,
        native-born and immigrant-and that experience taught me to
        value responsibility over rhetoric and to respect decisions
        that affect real people.
      </p>
      <p>
        My Service matured my view of our political process and reinforced
        the need for steadiness, competence, and thoughtful leadership.
        I am not running to be louder than anyone else- I'm running to Serve 
        with judgement, care, and accountability.
