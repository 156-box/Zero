                <h2>Meet WH R. Lane</h2>
                <p class="bio">
                    WH R. Lane is a husband, father, and U.S. military 
veteran running for 
Congress to stand up for working 
families and the communities that raised him. 
He believes opportunity should never be 
determined by zip code—and 
that leadership begins with service.

Raised in Southern California by his parents, 
Rita and Anthony Foster, 
Lane worked as a security manager 
at the Long Beach Airport before enlisting in 
the United States Army. 
As an infantryman, he earned 
multiple medals and awards, completed several 
non-combat deployments, 
and holds a Bachelor of Science in 
Computer Science—bringing together discipline, 
leadership, and modern 
problem-solving.

Lane and his wife—his partner of 13 years and 
wife of 9—were both 
raised in the inner cities of Los Angeles, 
specifically Compton and Long Beach. Together, 
they are raising their 
two children, Noah (9) and Peyton (8), 

who are the center of their world. As a family, 
they enjoy hiking, 
exploring the outdoors, and trying new foods.
